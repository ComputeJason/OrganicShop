# ðŸ§€ ðŸ¥¦ Organic Shop ðŸ¥•ðŸ¥‘
##### Whacky Shop to buy some nonsense (just some practice..)
Organic Shop is a server-side rendered app, with a very simple API. Spent some time on this playful design concept to practice simple HTML & CSS & demonstrate basic nodeJS concepts. Mostly for personal practice & learning. Do play around with the app! 
## Installation
Organic Farm requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
```sh
cd OrganicFarm
npm install 
node index.js
(alternatively, script "npm start" activates nodemon)
```
Run localhost:8000/ in browser to open the Overview page :) 

## Pages
- Overview page -->  Summary of all products

## Learning
1) NodeJS designed based on a single threaded non-blocking I/O model. Concurrency handled with the Event Loop.
2) Node is about modules. Usually we import core > 3rd party > internal dependencies. To export we simply call module.exports = __
```js
const http = require("http");
module.exports = (param) => {return param}
```

3) Creating a server to listen to events is quite simple. NOTE: res.end() can only be called once. 
```js
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { 
    res.end() 
}

server.listen(8000, "127.0.0.1", () => {
	console.log("Server is listening... ðŸ˜Ž");
});
```

4) Basic routing just involves retreiving the path name, and conditionally returning the corresponding output. Advanced ones involve retreiving qeury params as well. 
```js
// basic 
const path = req.url
if (path === "/overview" || path === "/") { res.end(output) } 
// advanced
const urlData = url.parse(req.url, true);
const path = urlData.pathname; 
const query = urlData.query; // use params 
```
5) Editting the header to provide useful information to the browser and user. Eg. return type, status no., additional meta data as key-value
```js
res.writeHead(200, { "Content-type": "text/html" });
res.writeHead(200, { "Content-type": "application/json" });
res.writeHead(404, {"Content-type": "text/html",});
res.end("<h1>Page doesn't exist!</h1>");
```


6) Each NodeJS File is actually wrapped in a function that provides all these node functionalities. eg. __dirname, require, process

### Dependenies
| 3rd Party | Type | Function |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Nodemon | Dev-Dep | On save, auto restarts application, so you don't need to do it manually |
| Slugify | Dep | easy-to-use module to create slugs from Strings. Slugs are human-readable unique identifiers for resources (good for SEO) |


### TechStack
- HTML
- Inline CSS
- NodeJS
